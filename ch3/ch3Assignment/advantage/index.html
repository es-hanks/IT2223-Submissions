        <ul>
            <li class="news">
                An upside of using CSS is that it separates the styling portion of your site from the structure portion. This makes code much easier
                to read and debug, and also enables designers and developers to work separately. In addition, an external style
                sheet boosts flexibility, allowing you to restyle pages without having to change any underlying content.

            <li>
                A second benefit of using CSS over inline styling is that it actually decreases the memory required to store
                the layout of the site. With the formatting being separate from the HTML code, the actual size of the documents
                is smaller, because the need to rewrite inline styling is eliminated. CSS also benefits from browser caching, 
                which means that your browser does not have to reload the styling each time a page is loaded, which reduces size
                and load times.

                Perhaps the greatest advantage of CSS is the ability to store your designs and utilize them on other pages.
                Instead of needing to re-create the style of one site to another, you can easily have consistent designs for 
                all pages on your website, without copy and pasting code from one HTML file to another. This greatly speeds up
                the design process while also improving consistency across all pages.
