                <dt><strong>Congratulations</strong></dt>
                    <dd><p>MGMT&apos;s <i>Congratulations</i> may initially give the listener whiplash if they expected more of the synth-pop 
                        sounds of the band&apos;s previous album, <i>Oracular Spectacular</i>. The switch to pure psychedelic rock shows
                        that the duo is willing to dive head first into pure chaos, blending shifting tempos with surreal lyrics that 
                        reveals more to the listener on each pass through the tracklist.</p>

                <dt><strong>Loss of Life</strong></dt>
                    <dd><p>MGMT&apos;s most recent album, <i>Loss of Life</i>, takes a much different approach than something like <i>Congratulations</i>.
                    It trades the psychedelic experimentation of their previous works for a much more grounded and melancholy tone. The album focuses
                    on themes of nostalgia and aging, delivered with a constant sense of uneasiness. The power of <i>Loss of Life</i> comes
                    from its subtlety rather than the bombastic sounds of MGMT&apos;s previous works.</p></dd>
                <dt><strong>Little Dark Age</strong></dt>
                    <dd><p>While not as initially well recieved as something like <i>Congratulations</i>, <i>Little Dark Age</i> initially
                    gained immense popularity from the titular single blowing up on social media sites such as TikTok. The album is a return
                    to the synth-pop sounds of MGMT&apos;s first album, but with a darker, more sinister feel. While perhaps not as profound as 
                    something like <i>Loss of Life</i>, <i>Little Dark Age</i> provides a great entry point into the band&apos;s discography
                    without feeling shallow.</p></dd>
