            <p class="underline">One of my current favorite hobbies is playing <i>Magic: the Gathering.</i> Magic is a 1993 card game made by Richard Garfield PhD, while there are many ways to play
            the most common format involves two players with 60 card decks attempting to reduce the other player's life total from twenty to zero. Recently, I got to attend a large tournament at a local game store with a prize
            pool of $2,000, which can be seen in the picture below.</p>
